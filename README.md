SECS is an extremely small, but feature-complete, ECS library. To my knowledge, it's the first ECS library
to have no unsafe blocks, and the smallest feature-complete ECS library.

It has everything you'd expect - entities, components, and systems - without any of the bloat.
This makes SECS' source code easier to read than other ECS crates, and means it compiles faster than other crates.
